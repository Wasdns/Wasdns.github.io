## About me

I am a first-year master student of ICT, CAS, and [College of Mathematics and Computer Science](http://cmcs.fzu.edu.cn/website/f/homepage) at [Fuzhou University](http://www.fzu.edu.cn/). 
My advisors are [Qun Huang](http://huangqundl.github.io/), and Dong Zhang.
My research interests including software-defined networking (SDN), network function virtualization (NFV), network virtualization (NV), programmable/stateful data plane (major in P4), network security, network measurement, and so on.
