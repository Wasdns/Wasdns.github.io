## About me

I am a undergraduate student in the [College of Mathematics and Computer Science](http://cmcs.fzu.edu.cn/website/f/homepage) at [Fuzhou University](http://www.fzu.edu.cn/).

My undergraduate research advisor is Prof. Dong Zhang.

My research interests lie in the Software-Defined Network (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV), Network Virtualization (NV), programmable/stateful data plane (major in P4), network security, network measurement, and so on.
